# Native Android Security

This conditional reference belongs to Cybersecurity. Its entrypoint determines assessment versus authorized hardening, output and evidence requirements. Read only applicable Android sections; do not require Android APIs for other platforms or turn an audit into unrequested source changes.

Use the project's supported SDK/library versions and this package's assessment or authorized-hardening workflow. Start with actual data and entrypoints, not a compliance score. Security controls must preserve a usable product and have negative tests. Code review alone cannot certify security.

## Map the boundary

Record: asset/data; caller or input source; trust boundary; intended authorized operation; enforcing owner; abuse case; control; check; residual limitation. Inspect the merged manifest and effective release configuration, not only a source manifest. Apply relevant sections below; do not add permissions, cryptography, biometrics or attestation without a concrete need.

## Identity and account isolation

- Prefer Android Credential Manager for supported passkey/password/federated credential flows. Validate credentials and authorize access on the backend; local biometric success or a visible screen is not server authorization. Bind sensitive local cryptographic operations to platform authentication when required, rather than trusting a UI boolean.
- For OAuth/OIDC use the provider's supported native flow, external user agent, authorization code with PKCE where applicable, and validated redirect/state/nonce according to the protocol. Do not embed a client secret or collect provider passwords in a WebView. Use maintained protocol libraries rather than inventing a login protocol.
- Scope caches, databases, image caches, outbox operations and jobs by the authenticated account/tenant. Logout invalidates tokens, cancels owned work and clears/protects data according to retention policy. Cancellation alone is insufficient: recheck session ownership before committing late results. Never flush an old user's offline writes as the next user.
- Refresh credentials with bounded coordination; clear credentials after rejected refresh. Distinguish reauthentication from authorization denial; do not loop forever on 401/403 or log tokens.

## Data, keys and transport

- Store private app data in app-private storage; external/shared storage and clipboard are not secret stores. Minimize collection/retention, redact analytics/crash logs, and avoid credentials in URIs, saved state, notification text, screenshots or WorkManager Data. Use FLAG_SECURE for sensitive windows only where policy requires it, accounting for accessibility/support; it is not a complete anti-exfiltration control.
- Define backup and device-transfer rules for supported Android versions, including legacy backup configuration and Android 12+ data extraction rules as applicable. Test effective restore behavior: encrypted blobs may be restored without usable Keystore keys. Recover by safe reauthentication or documented recovery, not plaintext fallback. Do not assume one manifest switch or encryption excludes all OEM transfer paths.
- Use maintained cryptography and Android Keystore for keys; no custom cipher/protocol, hard-coded keys, ECB, reused AEAD nonce/IV or non-cryptographic random for secrets. Store the required nonce/tag with authenticated ciphertext and handle key invalidation explicitly. DataStore/Room and Base64 do not provide encryption by themselves.
- Use HTTPS with platform trust/hostname validation and suitable Network Security Configuration. Keep debug trust overrides out of release. Never install a trust-all TrustManager, accept every hostname, ignore certificate errors or enable global cleartext to fix connectivity. Pinning is a threat/operations decision requiring rotation/recovery, not a universal default. Validate credential destination hosts and redirects.

## Components, intents and files

- Minimize exported activities/services/receivers/providers and explicitly configure exported state where required. An intentional launcher/deep-link Activity can be exported; internal components usually need no external caller. Protect necessary IPC with appropriate permissions and per-operation caller/input checks. Inspect manifest-merger contributions from libraries.
- Use explicit intents for internal routing. Treat nested intents, URI grants, extras and deserialized parcelables as untrusted. Reconstruct allowlisted intent fields rather than forwarding an arbitrary received Intent. Choose PendingIntent mutability deliberately (immutable when feasible), scope identity/action/data, and do not expose privileged capabilities to unintended recipients.
- Validate deep-link scheme, exact host, path, types, length and action before use. Verified App Links reduce interception; they do not authorize a record or transaction. A hostname substring/suffix check can accept an attacker domain. Validate again at the data operation and test cold/warm entry, logged-out users and another user's ID.
- Share narrowly scoped content URIs through FileProvider with minimal temporary grants and paths; do not expose a whole root or use file://. Treat provider names, filenames, MIME types and sizes as attacker-controlled. Canonicalize extraction/download destinations, reject traversal/symlink escapes and enforce size/decompression limits. Use parameterized SQL and bound query arguments; Room annotations do not make arbitrary dynamic SQL safe.

## WebView and untrusted content

Prefer browser/Custom Tabs for ordinary external websites or login. If WebView is required, restrict allowed HTTPS origins/navigation and disable unneeded JavaScript, file/content access and bridges. Do not expose addJavascriptInterface to untrusted content/frames or allow wildcard message origins. Verify the actual origin before privileged messaging; do not proceed past SSL errors. Review redirects, mixed content, downloads, popups and file chooser grants. Render remote text as text; rich HTML needs a reviewed rendering policy, not raw concatenation into a page.

## Release and dependency checks

Use pinned compatible dependencies from intended repositories and review security advisories, licenses and transitive additions. Protect signing keys/CI secrets; use dependency verification/locking and trusted wrapper/distribution checks when appropriate. R8 shrinking/obfuscation does not hide secrets or enforce authorization. Remove debug menus, test endpoints, verbose logs, release debuggability and WebView debugging from the shipped artifact. Integrity/root signals can support backend abuse decisions but must not be the only access-control boundary.

For each applicable control, record enforcing source/effective config and a negative test. At minimum exercise wrong account/record, malformed external URI, rejected authentication, invalid certificate against a controlled endpoint, sensitive backup/log leakage and unauthorized component entry when relevant. Do not run exploitation against third parties or use real private data. Use [integration tests](../../android-integration-testing/SKILL.md) for boundaries and actual release/device checks for platform claims. MASVS can organize the review; a filled checklist is not conformance evidence.

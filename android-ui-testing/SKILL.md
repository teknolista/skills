# Android Compose UI Testing

Before editing, inspect the actual project, toolchain, contracts and authorized scope. Implement a coherent change, run the relevant available checks, and distinguish executed evidence from pending work. Cross-package references are optional navigation: if a companion is unavailable, use the project-owned contract rather than inventing that companion's contents.

Reuse the project's existing types and selected libraries; sample Result, route, DI and test definitions are conditional patterns, not authority for a stack migration. For a material handoff, carry the target snapshot/variant, governing behavior, actual checks and remaining gap. Implementation completion, independent review and release acceptance remain separate.

Use native AndroidX Compose UI testing and `AndroidJUnitRunner` under `src/androidTest` for real Android behavior. Read [unit testing](../android-unit-testing/SKILL.md) for isolated logic and [integration testing](../android-integration-testing/SKILL.md) for non-UI storage/network boundaries.

## Dependencies and host

Align `androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-junit4` with the project's Compose BOM in `androidTestImplementation`. Add compatible AndroidX test runner/rules and JUnit4. For rules using the default Compose test Activity, add `androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-manifest` in the appropriate debug configuration; declare a custom host Activity in the correct manifest when needed.

`createComposeRule()` can host real Android Compose content in a default Activity. `createAndroidComposeRule<YourActivity>()` is appropriate when the Activity or its resources/lifecycle matter. Neither function name alone determines whether the test runs on a device or in a JVM framework simulation. Optional Robolectric tests can supplement device coverage; do not equate them with device evidence.

## API version and synchronization

Inspect **both the library version and imported factory/environment**. Native v2 factories are under `androidx.compose.ui.test.junit4.v2`; earlier factories use `androidx.compose.ui.test.junit4`. The v2 APIs use StandardTestDispatcher for composition, while legacy factories retain eager behavior; directly constructed environments can differ. Use the migration guide for the installed version, including any opt-ins/configuration changes.

When the resolved version supports `ComposeUiTestConfig`, use its supported configuration overloads. Newer v2 environments default to touch input; keyboard-focused tests should select keyboard input explicitly through that API when available. Do not rely on a previous test's input mode or copy a new configuration class into an older dependency set. A migration is a deliberate scoped change, not a reason to upgrade every test dependency.

Use ordinary synchronized node interactions/assertions and `waitForIdle()` first. With auto-advancement enabled, the Compose clock progresses composition work toward idle. Set `mainClock.autoAdvance = false` only when deliberately controlling animation/timing, then advance the appropriate clock to the intended frame. Do not add an arbitrary 1–3 second advance to every click.

Compose's clock does not control all external I/O or every ViewModel dispatcher. Use controlled fakes/idling resources or `waitUntil` for externally driven conditions, and use the matching coroutine test scheduler for separately managed work. Never replace event synchronization with `Thread.sleep`.

## Screen and feature coverage

Keep most ViewModel logic in unit tests. UI tests verify meaningful rendered behavior and wiring: editing, submit, disabled/loading/error/retry states, accessibility semantics, and callbacks. Use a real ViewModel with controlled repository collaborators for a screen test. Acquire it through a test owner/DI or cancel its scope explicitly; manually constructing a ViewModel outside a store does not give it lifecycle cleanup.

A feature-level flow can use real domain/data logic with MockEngine and a test database at external boundaries. Call it a feature flow with a controlled backend; it does not verify a real service deployment. Exercise a representative success path and realistic failure/recovery, rather than duplicating every unit input through UI.

Cover relevant rotation/recreation, state save/restore, system back versus toolbar Up, deep-link entry, duplicate taps, long content, RTL, font scale, keyboard/IME interactions, and TalkBack semantics. `ActivityScenario.recreate()` tests Activity recreation, not a real process kill. Use the appropriate restoration harness or a separate controlled system process-recreation scenario and describe which was actually tested.

## Selectors and native resources

Prefer visible text or meaningful semantics for accessible user actions. Use `contentDescription` for non-text icons/images; do not add descriptions to already labeled text just for tests. Use a test tag when repeated/dynamic content or a stable container cannot be identified reliably through user-facing semantics. Scope selectors to a parent or refine matchers for duplicate labels; don't force an ambiguous text selector.

```kotlin
// With a rule that exposes the Android host Activity:
val submit = composeTestRule.activity.getString(R.string.sign_in)
composeTestRule.onNodeWithText(submit).performClick()
composeTestRule.onNodeWithText(
    composeTestRule.activity.getString(R.string.login_error)
).assertIsDisplayed()
```

Read the same native resources as production rather than duplicating localized literals. Pass a resource resolver to reusable helpers that only know `SemanticsNodeInteractionsProvider`/generic Compose interfaces; those interfaces do not expose `.activity`. Use the unmerged semantics tree only when the merged tree cannot express the intended target, and explain the accessibility implications.

## Robot pattern for repeated flows

For repeated multi-step feature tests, encapsulate interaction vocabulary without hiding assertions or synchronization. A small Robot need not own the Activity or the rule:

```kotlin
class LoginRobot(
    private val nodes: SemanticsNodeInteractionsProvider,
    private val string: (Int) -> String
) {
    fun submit() = apply {
        nodes.onNodeWithText(string(R.string.sign_in)).performClick()
    }
    fun assertLoginError() = apply {
        nodes.onNodeWithText(string(R.string.login_error)).assertIsDisplayed()
    }
}
// Test: LoginRobot(composeTestRule) { id -> composeTestRule.activity.getString(id) }
// Content setup and external async synchronization remain explicit in the test.
```

Use imports from `androidx.compose.ui.test` for node interactions and provider types. Do not access `.activity` through `ComposeContentTestRule`. Avoid adding a Robot for a single trivial test unless it clarifies the flow.

## Cleanup and execution

Close test databases, HTTP clients/engines, and isolated DI containers; remove overrides and reset global dispatchers. Clear test-owned ViewModels and cancel collectors. Keep data isolated per test and do not rely on test order. Unexpected MockEngine requests should fail loudly rather than return a generic success.

Run the actual variant's connected-device task, for example `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`, or its configured managed-device task. Include required app startup, navigation, and release behavior in the chosen coverage. Report the device/API, executed cases, results, and limits. Passing previews, host-only tests, or a clock advance alone does not establish UI correctness.

## Check input routing and effective configuration

Drive real pointer/keyboard/semantics actions, not direct calls to onClick or assignment of a field's backing variable. Assert disabled/loading controls cannot submit a duplicate operation. Keep accessible selectors and test data deterministic across locales; using resource IDs avoids copy drift but does not itself test localization, RTL or TalkBack.

Test protected screens/deep links under an unauthorized fixture and after a session change. Inspect release-effective permissions and manifest settings separately from a debug test Activity. Keep screenshots and failure artifacts free of real credentials/private records. Passing a Compose semantics assertion is not a screen-reader session or a security assessment.
